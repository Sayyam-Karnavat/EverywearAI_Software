pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole --add-data "icon.png;." app.py





( IF the icon is not getting displayed after converting and adding it icon into exe using --add-data)
Key Changes Explained
Added resource_path Function:
This function checks if the application is running as a bundled executable (sys._MEIPASS exists) or as a script.
When bundled, it uses sys._MEIPASS to locate icon.png in the temporary extraction directory.
When running as a script, it uses the directory of the script file (__file__) to find icon.png.
This ensures the icon is found in both development and bundled environments.
Updated __main__ Block:
Changed icon_path = "icon.png" to icon_path = resource_path("icon.png") to use the dynamic path resolution.
Added Debug Output in FloatingIcon:
Added a check with pixmap.isNull() to print an error message if the icon fails to load, helping diagnose issues during testing.
